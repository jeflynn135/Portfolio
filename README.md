Portfolio

Goal:

To view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position


Changes:

1: When the portfolio is loaded, the user is presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to their work, and how to contact them

2: When the links are clicked in the navigation, the UI scrolls to the corresponding section

3: When the link to the section about their work is clicked on, the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications

4: When the developer's first application is presented, that application's image should be larger in size than the others

5: When the images of the applications are clicked on, that deployed application will be shown

6: When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices, the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport
